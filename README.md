# vimfiles
My Vim configuration. Best for development in Haxe.
  
NOTE: In order to use special [Vaxe](https://github.com/jdonaldson/vaxe) luxuries such as ctags and auto-importing, [Exuberant Ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/), and the .ctags file in the root directory are required. On Linux, the file should be placed in your home directory, in order to add [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) as a language in ctags. More information on generating ctags for individual projects lies within the .vimrc.
  
Easy Installation - does not include things like .ctags:  

        $ git clone https://github.com/bigfatman17/vimfiles.git arvim && cd arvim
        $ ./install
